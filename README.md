# My Docker setup
Here i'll specify all the docker containers that is currently running on my home server at the moment. I will be providing the docker-compose files as a good starting point for anyone interested in creating their own docker stack, but do head over to the independant docker hubs to pull down the entire repo/image to your server. 

More information: https://hub.docker.com/

Where I got most of my containers: https://github.com/linuxserver
